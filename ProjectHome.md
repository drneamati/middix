Middix is an extremely lightweight online desktop licensed under the GNU GPL, and written in Javascript and PHP.

It is extremely easy to use, and to develop for, with a simple Javascript API for accessing and controlling all factors of the system.

Programs can be packaged and distributed as compressed (.mxp) files, to be extracted on runtime, or standalone (.mxs) script files.

Libraries can also be distributed as both Javascript files, or PHP files with Javascript and AJAX API wrappers.

Middix contains a full-featured file protection system, including administrator rights, encrypted passwords, and inaccessible folders via standard HTTP, through the use of .htaccess.

**Update 17-12-2012**
Development of Middix 2 is now started and can be followed at http://github.com/ale55andro/middix
